## A Love Story About Two Circles

This is the official repository for my submission to the first module of COMS3930 Creative Embedded Systems.
The project serves as a tiny art installation that tells the story of two circles that are (or maybe aren't) in love.
The project is written in C++ with the original intention being to run it on a [TTGO T1 Display ESP32 Microcontroller](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/lilygo%C2%AE-ttgo-t-display-1-14-inch-lcd-esp32-control-board),
but it can be modified to run on any microcontroller that can be flashed with the Arduino or similar IDEs.

## Getting Started

To get this installation up and running to a device near you, you should first begin by cloning this repository by
